     		<p>Linqiu Wang is a doctoral student, major in Physics Electronics at the School of Electronics, Peking University.</p>
     		<p>During Wang's tenure at Alibaba, she was mainly responsible for the full process development of physical design for ultra-low power IoT chips on the 12nm platform. 
          She used Innovus+PrimeTime to complete place, clock tree, route, and power. 
          She was also responsible for optimizing the overall physical design flow and library for multiple projects, 
          communicating and collaborating closely with the front-end design team to maximize energy efficiency and complete time series analysis and convergence. 
          Power&preference&area was optimized while meeting requirementschip of physical design.
          During her PIE internship experience, she participated in the design and improvement of the 0.15um OTP device process flow. 
          She completed the process failure and analysis of 0.15um OTP devices, 
          tested the correlation between the BPSG thickness of ILD layer and crosstalk failure in 0.15um OTP devices and 
          tested the correlation between the Spacer layout size of 0.15um OTP devices and crosstalk failure issues.
